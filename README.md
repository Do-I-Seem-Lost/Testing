# Testing
Nothin' to see here!

I'm ever so slowly learning to code.

I am attempting to develop a small Python program which will enable me to be a more efficient worker. I am enabling it to take a simple task or two off of my hands. 
I foresee the development process as being full of trifles.


This is the best way for me to learn how to use this platform. I will, eventually, request assistance with problems which I've created myself. I was drawn to Hacktoberfest last year. I was disheartened by more experienced users who were very competitive. It was hard to get a word in, as it were. That's a good part of the reason why I've avoided working on this. But I want to learn, so here I am.

One of these days I'll have to show some code. Eep.
